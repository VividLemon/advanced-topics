	<h1>HTTP and AJAX</h1>
	<p>
		You may want to open your gmail account and then look at the Network tab in the developer tools.
		You'll notice that the web page is making various ajax calls (for example, to check for new emails).
	</p>
	<p>
		Make sure to start the JSON server and watch the users.json file:
	</p>
	<pre><b>json-server -w users.json</b></pre>
	<h2>Traditional HTML Form Posting</h2>
	<p>
		Below is a traditional HTML form.
		If you enter some data and press the submit button, the data will be POSTed and you will be redirected to the JSON server (note the attributes in the FORM element).
	</p>
	<form method="POST" action="http://localhost:3000/users">
		<label for="txtFirstName">First Name:</label>
		<input type="text" id="txtFirstName" name="firstName" />
		<br>
		<label for="txtLastName">Last Name:</label>
		<input type="text" id="txtLastName" name="lastName" />
		<br>
		<label for="txtEmail">Email:</label>
		<input type="text" id="txtEmail" name="email" />
		<br>
		<label for="txtPassword">Password:</label>
		<input type="password" id="txtPassword" name="password" />
		<br>
		<label></label>
		<input type="submit">
	</form>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you open the Network tab in the Chrome developer tools and submit the form again, you can see information about the HTTP request and response.
			You should see a request for 'users'.
			Click on that line and you'll be able to see all the details of the request and response.
		</li>
		<li>
			Notice that the Request Method is <b>POST</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Also notice that the <b>Content-Type</b> header in the request is <b>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</b>.
			If you poke around a bit, you should see the body of the request.
			Note that it looks something like this:
			<pre><b>firstName=blah&lastName=blah&email=blah&password=blah</b></pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			This is how the data is formatted for traditional HTML form posting (form-urlencoded)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Posting Data with AJAX</h2>
	<p>
		If you enter data into the form, and click the button below (rather than the submit button in the form), the data will be sent via AJAX rather than a traditional form posting.
	</p>
	<button id="btn1">AJAX POST (Sending JSON formatted data)</button>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Note that when the button is pressed, the browser doesn't redirect (we stay on this page).
			AJAX requests will not redirect the browser, the request is made behind the scene.
		</li>
		<li>
			Note that there are actually two requests made. An OPTIONS request is sent before the actual POST request

		</li>
		<li>
			If you look at the JavaScript code, you'll see that the <b>fetch()</b> method is used to make the AJAX request.
			The fetch method is built into JavaScript but it has some limitations, so we'll be using a popular library called <b>Axios</b> to make our AJAX calls.
		</li>
		<li>
			When posting data with AJAX, you can send the data in different formats (although JSON has become the dominant way of formatting data).
			If you click the button below, the data will be sent in the traditional format.
			Note that the <b>Content-Type</b> header should be set to so that the web server knows what data format is being used.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<button id="btn2">AJAX POST (Sending form-urlencoded data)</button>
	<h2>Making HTTP Requests with CURL</h2>
	<p>
		You don't need a browser (or JavaScript) to make HTTP requests.
		There are many tools that allow you to send HTTP requests.
		One of the most common tools (that hackers use) is call CURL.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open the terminal and try a few commands:
	</p>
	<pre><b>
curl --request GET http://localhost:3000/users/

curl --request GET http://localhost:3000/users/1

curl --request POST http://localhost:3000/users/ -d firstName=Bob -d lastName=Smith -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'

curl --request PUT http://localhost:3000/users/1 -d firstName=Bob -d lastName=Smith -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'

curl --request PATCH http://localhost:3000/users/1 -d firstName="Robert" -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
# WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PUT AND A PATCH REQUEST

curl --request DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/1 
	</b></pre>
	<h2>Documenting an API</h2>
	<p>
		For your final project, you will have to document the API of your web service.
		Here is the documentation for the parts that we are building together:

	<h2>Questions</h2>
	<p>
		Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgrP6r-cFUQ" target="_blank">video</a> about designing the API for a web service.
		Then answer the following questions (you may have to do some googling):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What is a RESTful API? What are some other approaches to building a web api?
			<div class="answer">It is building an api that other developers can use over HTTP. This means no one has to download anything to take advantage.</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			What type of request method is used to insert a new resource?
			<div class="answer">Post</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the difference between a <b>PUT</b> request and a <b>PATCH</b> request?
			<div class="answer">Put will delete all other data that exists in the update, then updates the information. Patch will append (or change) the information that is with it.</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			How might you allow requests that specify how a collection should be sorted?
			<div class="answer">Put your answer here</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the purpose of an OPTIONS request?
			<div class="answer">As I understand it, an options request will return which http methods are allowed by a resource. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			What is URL rewriting? Note that many web sites and web APIs make use of it.
			<div class="answer">Websites use it to change what the actual url is, to something more understandable and readable. It takes a very long URL and condenses it into something readable and easily rememberable</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			Complete the table above and add the API calls for your final project.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Create a file named main.js and put all the JavaScript code from step 1 into it.
		Then link this page to main.js.
	</p>
	<p>
		Add JavaScript code to main.js that will allow users to choose an option from the select box to change how the rows in the table are sorted.
		Here's how the sorting should work:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If the <b>price</b> option is selected, the rows should be sorted by prices (highest to lowest)</li>
		<li>If the <b>customer</b> option is selected, the rows should be sorted by customer (alphabetically)</li>
		<li>If the <b>product</b> option is selected, the rows should be sorted by product (alphabetically)</li>
		<li>If the <b>date</b> option is selected, the rows should be sorted by date (the most recent dates should be displayed first)</li>
	</ol>

	<select class="sort" onchange="displayTable()">
		<option>price</option>
		<option>customer</option>
		<option>product</option>
		<option>date</option>
	</select>
	<div id="table-container"></div>
